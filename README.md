# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-From-Scratch

![ML](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML-Algorithms_From_Scratch-blue.svg) 

## Objectives:

This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in Python and Numpy. All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. 

The intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure, not to provide the most efficient implementations.
